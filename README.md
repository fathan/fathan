### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full-Stack Engineer with a strong focus on Frontend Development. I specialize in building modern, scalable, and high-performance web applications using JavaScript and TypeScript, with expertise in frameworks like React, Vue, Next.js, Nuxt.js, React native, Ionic

Beyond frontend, I'm also familiar with backend development, working with Node.js, Express.js, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails to build robust APIs and backend services.

Currently, I'm working as a Freelancer, previously contributing to Loket, Wmotion, and Jojonomic. I love exploring new technologies, optimizing UI/UX, and writing clean, maintainable code.

ðŸ’¡ Always eager to learn and collaborate on exciting projects!
